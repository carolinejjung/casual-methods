Finding Methods to Determine the Effect of Anti-Anxiety Medicine on Memory Recall (Causal Inference Course Project)

Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that are commonly prescribed to treat anxiety disorders, insomnia, and seizures. However, previous research has shown that side effects include impaired cognition, especially memory, and are prone to causing psychological and behavioral abnormalities (Breggin, 1998). Thus, the research question asked, “How can we perform preliminary analysis of the effect of anti-anxiety medicine (benzodiazepines) on memory recall before testing it on real humans?” Since this question concerned human experiments, we started with a virtual dataset on Islanders that closely mimicked real-life humans. This project allowed us to practice analyzing the effect of this medicine without needing human consent so that in the future, we can extend these methods to a more complex design for the greater population.
